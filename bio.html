                    My early years were spent in the Shortland Suburbs, at Our Lady of Victories primary school.
                    I was a chubby little kid with asthma problems and sleep apnea. I would spend my time in Shortland with friends
                    until I was 10 and my little sister was born in 2019. I "Graduated" year 6 and got everyone to sign my shirt.
                    this was just when covid restrictions were loosening.

                        My name is Lachlan Jones, and I’m sixteen years old. Year 11. One of the most important years of my life, or so everyone
                        keeps telling me. Exams, responsibilities, the so-called “pathway to the future.” But honestly? I’m just trying to make it through
                        the chaos of school, family, and figuring out who the hell I’m supposed to be.
                    </h2>
                    <h2 id="Para3">
                        I live in a small town, the kind where everyone knows
                        everyone, and rumors travel faster than the wind. My parents—Dad, an overworked mechanic, and Mum, a part-time nurse—are constantly
                        busy. We’re not poor, but we’re not well-off either. Just that middle ground where we have enough to get by but not enough for luxuries.
                        My older brother, Jake, left for university last year, and ever since, things have been different at home. He was always the golden
                        child—straight A’s, the perfect role model. Now, it feels like my parents expect me to follow in his footsteps, but school has never
                        come as easy to me as it did for him.
                    </h2>
                    <h2 id="Para4">
                        I used to love school when I was younger. Back in primary, I was one of the smart kids, the ones
                        who always had their hand up first. But somewhere along the way, things changed. Maybe it was the pressure, or maybe it was just me.
                        Now, my grades are average at best, and I can feel my parents’ disappointment every time they check my report card. “You just need to
                        apply yourself,” they say, but they don’t understand how exhausting it is. Teachers drilling us with coursework, the looming fear of
                        exams, and the constant competition with classmates who seem to have their entire futures mapped out already.
                    </h2>
                    <h2 id="Para5">
                        And then there’s the social
                        side of things. I wouldn’t say I’m popular, but I’m not invisible either. I have a small group of friends—Ryan, Leo, and Sophie.
                        We’ve known each other since Year 7, and they’re the only ones who get me. Ryan’s the class clown, always cracking jokes, even when we’re
                        supposed to be serious. Leo’s the quiet one, but when he speaks, it’s always something smart or deep. Sophie, well, she’s different.
                        She’s got this way of making you feel like you matter, even when you don’t believe it yourself. Lately, I think I might like her as more
                        than just a friend, but I have no idea what to do about it.
                    </h2>
                    <h2 id="Para6">
                        Outside of school, my life is pretty simple. I love football, but I’m not good
                        enough to go pro. I play video games, watch movies, and sometimes, when I’m alone, I write. It’s not something I tell people, not even my
                        friends, but writing helps me make sense of everything. Sometimes, I imagine a version of myself that’s more confident, someone who doesn’t
                        second-guess every decision or feel like they’re constantly falling behind.
                    </h2>
                    <h2 id="Para7">
                        Then there’s the stuff I don’t talk about. Like the fact that my
                        dad and I barely get along anymore. Ever since Jake left, it’s like he’s shifted all his expectations onto me, and I can never measure up.
                        Every conversation turns into a lecture about responsibility, about how I need to “be a man” and “stop wasting time.” He doesn’t get that
                        I’m not Jake, and I never will be. Mum tries to play peacemaker, but I know she’s tired too. Some nights, I hear them arguing when they
                        think I’m asleep, and it scares me. What if one day, one of them just gives up on the other?
                    </h2>
                    <h2 id="Para8">
                        Year 11 is supposed to be the time when we
                        start thinking about our future, but honestly, I have no idea what mine looks like. University? A job? Travel? All I know is that right
                        now, I feel like I’m stuck in this in-between place—too young to be an adult, too old to just be a kid. Everyone around me seems so sure
                        of themselves, and I’m just hoping that one day, I’ll wake up and everything will finally make sense.
                    </h2>
                    <h2>
                        But for now, I just keep going. One day at a time.
